It often happens that information about people is displayed in many places on a web page. The particular challenge is to keep the individual places in the frontend consistent at all times.

With the help of this module, such people can be managed centrally in the backend of Contao in a clear list. The data from this list can then be easily used and displayed in different places in the frontend.

## Install

```bash
composer require cgoit/contao-persons-bundle
```
